                    Hi! I'm Vatsal. 
                    I am an Honors Computer Science major attending Texas A&M University.
                    <br><br>
                    I am taking CSCE 445 as a way to expand my knowledge on the impact and change brought by current forms of media. This includes interfaces for communicating with newer technologies.
                    <br><br>
                    Media plays a huge role in our day to day lives as we use it for practically everything. As we develop, we also change, so 
                    learning more about this shift is essential on staying up to date with current technologies. Understanding why certain forms of media
                    succeed in certain scenarios is important for choosing the correct tool for the job.
